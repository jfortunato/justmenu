## JustMenu (name TBD)

### Developer friendly online ordering system for restaurants.

> This project is nowhere near production ready. When it has reached a usable state this
README will be updated accordingly.

#### Developer First

> **S.O.L.I.D.**  
  **Test Driven Development**

This project is meant to be a **distributed** system for individual developers to quickly create
online ordering systems for small business restaurants. There is no central "HUB" where all the orders are processed. Instead, any developer (freelancer and corporation alike) can use this project and get started creating a website for local restaurants. **All the control belongs to the developer.**

#### Some of the goals/features of this project

* **Easy for developers**  
  Just composer install and place a few files in the correct place to get going.

* **Menu simplification**  
  On very large menus, items can be combined into a single "or" choice. This helps
  make the menu much easier to navigate as the result will be less items showing up.

* **Easy to create menus**  
  A robust admin section should allow for rapidly building online menus.

* **Adaptable**  
  The system should be able to take on even the most complex menus.

* **Mobile Friendly**  
  Responsive design and touch features to be implemented.

* **Multiple Receiving Options**  
  The restaurant will have the option of the delivery method of the orders, not all of which even require them to have an internet connection in their place of business.
  Some ideas include:
  * Tablets
  * Fax
  * Email
  * SMS
  * Automated phone calls
  * POS Integration
